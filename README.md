This project is made for 2 reasons. I never made a idle clicker game. Despite the fact that it isn't hard, I never made one and wanted to give a try. The reason is to have a
template for whenever I want to make a clicker game. This is supposed to be a blank canvas. In this template you can: Click on the enemies, get coins from the enemies,
buy autoclickers, enemies can die, enemies can change (sprites and stats), backgrounds can change and the enemies have basic animations. This template is great to change/ add
mechanics.
